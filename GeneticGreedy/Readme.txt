This a program that will find the shortest path to travel among several points

1)Open the program, there are a section that indicates several testing parameters
            Mutation probability < crossover probabilty
            Generation <=50
            Test_size <= 10
            Population <=100
            Otherwise, the program execute extremely slow

2)After the intial parameters are settled or use the default value, execute the program

3)The program will show the target location set and result path in StdOut

4)A png file that visualize the result will be saved in the local directory 

5)Close the program to exit
